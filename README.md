Introduction to Programming Course LZW Tree
## Summary
This project contains source files and sample data files for lzw tree.
The goal was only to excercise basic cpp, therefore its performance is **BAD**.
## Build
Provided a makefile, **BUT YOU MUST TUNE IT FOR LINUX**.
This is due to the fact that with mingw on win, the executable extension is needed.
## Run
If you dont provide any cl args, then the app will print to cout the usage.
Sample folder provides two example source files and an example output.
